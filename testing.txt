User Persona:
    Andrea Jones
    Age: 52
    Occupation: Librarian
    Education: Master’s degree

    Who is Andrea?
    Andrea is a recent empty nester after her daughter just moved away to college. She’s seeking an easy and quick way to adopt a dog without long waits or complicated applications.

    Challenges:
    * She’s trained in finding reliable, easy to follow resources so she moves on quickly from poorly designed sites
    * Is wary about sharing personal details online and needs easy access to a contact email or number to speak with someone directly or needs reviews and testimonials to ease her mind

    Other Details: 
    * Andrea is tech savvy from working in a library and helping others do research. She’s capable of using multiple browsers but her library and work computer offer Chrome as the main browser since most library applications are most compatible with this browser.
    * Owns a three year old Macbook and a 1 year old iPhone but will browse on her work computer during breaks to search for dog adoption sites
